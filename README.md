# Bird Classification using CNN (InceptionV3)

## Overview

This project aims to classify bird species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the InceptionV3 architecture. The trained model can recognize and distinguish between various bird species based on input images.

## Features

- Bird species classification
- Utilizes the InceptionV3 pre-trained model for image recognition
- Data augmentation for improved model generalization

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- InceptionV3
- Git

## Dataset

The bird dataset used for training and testing the model consists of 7400 images from 50 different species(Note: This is reduced dataset of orignal dataset)
